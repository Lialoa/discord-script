# Nuro-cord

A simple discord client mod for both the web and dekstop clients!

## Installation

Yarn is required because webpack is garbage and doesnt bump their dependancies

Install dependancies: `yarn install`

Build debug: `yarn run dev`

Build production: `yarn run build`

## Running

Paste the script into console or use tampermonkey

You can verify it is running by typing `.help` into chat

I will eventually make an injection script for the desktop app and possibly and extention for the webapp

## TODO

Make help command show help and details about commands

Make imporve command api with typed argument support

Make commands require an author

Make an extention and an injection script

Make a gui that can edit config (after making config command)

Make some visual indicator to show its running after it first starts

Make configarable with config command

Add regex filtering to commands

Improve net manager to not make requests instead of sending them to localhost

Make the commands not load the Nuro pfp from network and load it locally instead

Add documentation

Fix CommandManager cause its dog shit
